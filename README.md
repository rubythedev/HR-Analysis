## Introduction
Understanding workforce trends is essential for optimizing HR strategies. This analysis examines active, terminated, and newly hired employees, providing insights into performance ratings, hiring patterns, and pay disparities across different demographics.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze workforce composition across departments.
- Assess performance ratings by department and demographic groups.
- Track hiring, termination, and active employee trends over time.
- Examine the correlation between age and pay rate.
- Investigate income disparities based on gender and race.
- Highlight key insights for quick and actionable decision-making.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preparation
   - Imported and cleaned multiple datasets to ensure accuracy.
   - Merged tables using Python, handling missing values and duplicate records.
   
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Counted active, terminated, and hired employees.
   - Analyzed department-wise workforce distribution.
   - Examined performance ratings across different categories.

### 3. Demographic Analysis
   - Analyzed hiring, termination, and active employee distribution by gender, race, and age.
   - Investigated marital status correlation with performance.
   - Examined disparities in pay rates by gender and race.

### 4. Data Visualization & Insights
   - Developed interactive visualizations with hover features to display key details.
   - Highlighted highest percentages in each category for quick data interpretation.
   - Explored trends such as decreasing termination rates and age-pay correlations.

## Visual Representations
- **Workforce Overview Dashboard**: Breakdown of active, terminated, and hired employees.
- **Department Performance Dashboard**: Performance ratings across different departments.
- **Demographic Distribution Dashboard**: Workforce count by gender, race, and age.
